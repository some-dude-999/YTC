# Git Rules

**If it's not on main branch, it FAILED.**

- Always commit and push immediately after any code change
- Always work directly on main branch
- Only branch if GitHub technically requires it, then immediately merge to main
- Verify changes are on main before considering task complete

**MANDATORY: End every response with a link to create the pull request for the changes just made. No link = task not done.**

**HTML File Tracking:**
- After each run, check LINK.txt
- If any .html file was created/modified and not in LINK.txt, add it
- If the path changed, update it
- If already in there, leave it alone
- Applies to ALL .html files in any folder

Not on main = useless code.
