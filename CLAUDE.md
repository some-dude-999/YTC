# Project Development & Documentation Rules

## 🚨 FIRST PRIORITY: DOCUMENTATION
**No docs? CREATE THEM FIRST.** Understand the system before coding. Update when understanding changes.

## 🔗 AUTOMATED LINK MANAGEMENT
**Check for `PythonHelpers/link_manager.py` first**
- If it exists → Use it
- If not → Create a Python script that:
  - Gets repo owner/name from git remote
  - Finds all .html files
  - Generates GitHub Pages URLs: `https://[owner].github.io/[repo]/[path]`
  - Updates LINK.txt with proper URL encoding
  - Preserves existing descriptions

Run after every HTML change: `python PythonHelpers/link_manager.py`

---

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION FILES
Every `.html` needs a `.txt`: `dashboard.html` → `dashboard.txt`

**Required in each .txt:**
- What it does & data sources
- How it works (key functions)  
- Dependencies & integrations
- Corrections when initial understanding was wrong

Update docs with EVERY change. If wrong, fix immediately.

---

## 🔄 Git Rules
**Not on main = didn't happen.** Always work on main. Commit & push immediately after changes. End every response with PR link.

---

## 🔗 HTML File Tracking (LINK.txt) - NOW AUTOMATED!
**Use the Python Link Manager for automatic tracking:**
```bash
python PythonHelpers/link_manager.py
```

### What Gets Tracked Automatically
- All .html files in the repository
- Proper GitHub Pages URLs (https://username.github.io/repo/path/file.html)
- Handles special characters and spaces in filenames
- Preserves existing descriptions when updating

### Manual Review After Running Script
- Check LINK.txt for new entries marked with `[Add description for...]`
- Update these placeholders with meaningful descriptions
- Commit the updated LINK.txt with your code changes

### LINK.txt Format (Auto-generated)
```
# GitHub Pages Links for some-dude-999/YTC
# Auto-generated by PythonHelpers/link_manager.py

https://some-dude-999.github.io/YTC/index.html - Main landing page
https://some-dude-999.github.io/YTC/MUSIC%20THUMBNAIL%20GEN.html - Music thumbnail generator tool
https://some-dude-999.github.io/YTC/dashboard.html - Analytics dashboard
```

## ⚠️ Remember
1. **NO DOCUMENTATION = STOP! Create it first before ANY other work**
2. **Check for PythonHelpers/link_manager.py first - use it if it exists!**
3. **Not on main = useless code**
4. **Incorrect understanding = update documentation immediately**
5. **Every change needs this exact sequence:**
   - Check/create documentation FIRST
   - Make code changes
   - Update documentation if understanding changed
   - **Run `python PythonHelpers/link_manager.py`** (auto-updates LINK.txt)
   - Review and update descriptions in LINK.txt
   - Git add, commit, push to main
   - Provide pull request link in response
6. **Documentation is a message to your future self - make it count!**

## 🎯 Quick Start Checklist for New Sessions
```bash
# 1. Check if link manager exists
ls PythonHelpers/link_manager.py

# 2. If not found, create it (use the script above)
mkdir -p PythonHelpers
# [create link_manager.py with the provided code]

# 3. After any HTML changes, run:
python PythonHelpers/link_manager.py

# 4. Review and update LINK.txt descriptions

# 5. Commit everything
git add .
git commit -m "Updated HTML files and documentation"
git push origin main
```

## 🧠 Documentation Philosophy
**Think of documentation as a conversation with your future self:**
- What would you want to know if you saw this code for the first time?
- What mistakes might you make without proper context?
- What's the quickest path to understanding the entire system?
- Document not just WHAT the code does, but WHY it does it that way

This documentation system ensures that as projects grow, any new LLM can quickly understand the entire codebase, data flow, and system architecture.
