=== YouTube Transcript Scraper ===
PROJECT: YTC (YouTube Tools Collection)
COMPONENT: YouTube Channel Transcript Scraper
CREATED: 2025-11-21
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-21 - Initial creation

DATA SOURCES:
- API: YouTube Data API v3 - Retrieves channel videos, titles, and descriptions
- API: YouTube Transcript API (youtube-transcript-api library) - Extracts video transcripts
- User Input: YouTube channel URL/ID - Specifies which channel to scrape
- Output File: VidsTranscript.csv - CSV file with 3 columns (title, description, transcript)

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Extract all video metadata and transcripts from a YouTube channel and save to CSV
- Key Functions:
  * extract_channel_id() - Extracts channel ID from various YouTube URL formats
  * get_channel_videos() - Uses YouTube Data API to retrieve all video IDs from a channel
  * get_video_details() - Fetches video title and description for each video
  * get_video_transcript() - Extracts transcript text using youtube-transcript-api
  * save_to_csv() - Writes all collected data to VidsTranscript.csv
- Error Handling:
  * Handles videos without transcripts (marks as "No transcript available")
  * Handles API quota limits and rate limiting
  * Handles private/deleted videos

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries:
  * yt-dlp - For fetching channel videos and metadata (NO API KEY NEEDED!)
  * youtube-transcript-api - For extracting video transcripts
- APIs Required:
  * None! Both libraries work without authentication

INTEGRATION:
- Standalone script that runs independently
- Outputs: VidsTranscript.csv with columns [Video Title, Video Description, Transcript]
- Can be run from command line with channel URL as parameter
- No integration with other HTML tools in the repository

USAGE:
```bash
# Install dependencies first
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script - NO API KEY NEEDED!
python PythonHelpers/youtube_transcript_scraper.py
```

NO API KEY SETUP REQUIRED:
This script uses yt-dlp which doesn't require any API keys or authentication.
Just install the dependencies and run!

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS:
- Initially tried YouTube Data API v3, but it required API keys and had quota limits
- Switched to yt-dlp which is more reliable and requires NO API keys
- yt-dlp handles channel scraping without authentication
- Transcripts are only available for videos that have them enabled
- The script works on local machines with proper internet access
- May not work in restricted/sandbox environments with network proxies

NOTES:
- The channel URL configured by default is: https://www.youtube.com/@RichAndLegit
- yt-dlp automatically handles @handle-based URLs
- Some videos may not have transcripts (disabled by creator or auto-generated unavailable)
- The script will mark videos without transcripts in the CSV
- For very large channels (1000+ videos), the script may take a while to run
- No authentication or API keys required - completely free to use
- Includes small delays between requests to avoid rate limiting

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add progress bar for long-running operations
- Add resume capability for interrupted runs
- Add filtering by date range or video count
- Add support for multiple channels in one run
- Add support for playlists in addition to channels
