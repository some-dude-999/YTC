=== YouTube Transcript Scraper ===
PROJECT: YTC (YouTube Tools Collection)
COMPONENT: YouTube Channel Transcript Scraper
CREATED: 2025-11-21
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-21 - Initial creation

DATA SOURCES:
- API: YouTube Data API v3 - Retrieves channel videos, titles, and descriptions
- API: YouTube Transcript API (youtube-transcript-api library) - Extracts video transcripts
- User Input: YouTube channel URL/ID - Specifies which channel to scrape
- Output File: VidsTranscript.csv - CSV file with 3 columns (title, description, transcript)

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Extract all video metadata and transcripts from a YouTube channel and save to CSV
- Key Functions:
  * extract_channel_id() - Extracts channel ID from various YouTube URL formats
  * get_channel_videos() - Uses YouTube Data API to retrieve all video IDs from a channel
  * get_video_details() - Fetches video title and description for each video
  * get_video_transcript() - Extracts transcript text using youtube-transcript-api
  * save_to_csv() - Writes all collected data to VidsTranscript.csv
- Error Handling:
  * Handles videos without transcripts (marks as "No transcript available")
  * Handles API quota limits and rate limiting
  * Handles private/deleted videos

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries:
  * google-api-python-client - For YouTube Data API v3 access
  * youtube-transcript-api - For extracting video transcripts
  * pandas - For CSV manipulation and data handling
- APIs Required:
  * YouTube Data API v3 - Requires API key (user must provide)
  * YouTube Transcript API - No key required, uses public transcript data

INTEGRATION:
- Standalone script that runs independently
- Outputs: VidsTranscript.csv with columns [Video Title, Video Description, Transcript]
- Can be run from command line with channel URL as parameter
- No integration with other HTML tools in the repository

USAGE:
```bash
# Install dependencies first
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set YouTube API key as environment variable
export YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Or edit the script to hardcode your API key

# Run the script
python PythonHelpers/youtube_transcript_scraper.py
```

API KEY SETUP:
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable YouTube Data API v3
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Copy the API key and either:
   - Set as environment variable: export YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your_key"
   - Or hardcode in the script (less secure but simpler for personal use)

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS:
- Initially planned to scrape without API, but YouTube Data API is the most reliable method
- API has daily quota limits (10,000 units/day default), each video listing costs ~1 unit
- Large channels may require multiple runs or quota increase
- Transcripts are only available for videos that have them enabled

NOTES:
- The channel URL provided is: https://www.youtube.com/@RichAndLegit
- Need to extract channel ID from this handle-based URL
- Some videos may not have transcripts (disabled by creator or auto-generated unavailable)
- The script will skip videos without transcripts and note them in the CSV
- For very large channels (1000+ videos), consider adding pagination and resume capability
- API key should be kept secure - use environment variables in production
- Rate limiting: YouTube API has quota limits, script includes retry logic for rate limits

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Add progress bar for long-running operations
- Add resume capability for interrupted runs
- Add filtering by date range or video count
- Add support for multiple channels in one run
- Add support for playlists in addition to channels
