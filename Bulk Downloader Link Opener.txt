=== Bulk Downloader Link Opener.txt ===
PROJECT: YTC - YouTube Content Tools
COMPONENT: Bulk Download Parallelizer
CREATED: 2025-11-19
LAST UPDATED: 2025-11-19 - Initial documentation created

DATA SOURCES:
- User Input: Number of tabs (1-50), download site selection
- File: None (no external data loaded)
- API: None (no API calls made)

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Main Purpose: Opens multiple browser tabs to parallelize YouTube video downloads
- Key Functions:
  * openTabs() - Opens browser tabs with 1-second delay between each
  * showStatus(message, type) - Displays status messages to user
- Event Handlers:
  * File input validation (min 1, max 50 tabs)
  * Enter key support for quick submission
  * Pop-up blocker detection warnings
- Rate Limiting: 1 second delay between tab openings to prevent browser blocking

DEPENDENCIES:
- External Libraries: None (pure vanilla JavaScript)
- Project Files: None (standalone HTML file)
- APIs Required: None

INTEGRATION:
- Receives data from: User form input only
- Sends data to: None (opens external URLs in new tabs)
- Triggers: User clicks "Open Tabs" button or presses Enter

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Default download site: https://v2.yt1s.biz/
- Maximum tabs: 50 (hard limit to prevent browser overload)
- Tab opening interval: 1000ms (1 second)
- Uses window.open() with '_blank' target

WORKFLOW:
1. User enters number of tabs to open (default: 10)
2. User selects download site (currently only yt1s.biz available)
3. User clicks "Open Tabs"
4. Script opens tabs sequentially with 1-second delays
5. Progress counter updates in real-time
6. Button is disabled during operation to prevent double-clicks

BROWSER COMPATIBILITY:
- Requires pop-up permission from user
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- May be blocked by aggressive pop-up blockers

USER WARNINGS:
- Pop-up blocker must be disabled for this site
- Maximum 50 tabs enforced to prevent system overload
- Each tab requires manual interaction for actual download

CORRECTIONS & CLARIFICATIONS:
- Initially thought: This tool downloads videos automatically
- Actually: This tool only opens tabs to the download site; user must still paste URLs and click download in each tab
- Why this matters: This is a workflow optimization tool, not an automated downloader

NOTES:
- This tool helps users process multiple videos faster by having multiple download windows ready
- Users still need to manually paste video URLs into each opened tab
- Consider adding bookmarklet version for easier access
- Future enhancement: Add more download sites as options
